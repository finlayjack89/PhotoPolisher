## Task: Refactor Auto-Deskew Algorithm in `src/lib/image-rotation-utils.ts`

The current auto-deskew implementation is failing on textured objects (like denim bags) and objects with rounded corners. The current approach of using flood-fill and fixed-percentage canvas sampling is incorrect for transparent PNGs.

Please completely rewrite `src/lib/image-rotation-utils.ts` with the following robust architecture:

### 1. Logic Overhaul
Instead of complex component extraction, use **Alpha Channel Scanning** to find the object's "feet":
1. **Detect Object Bounds:** First, scan the alpha channel to find the `minY` and `maxY` of the actual object (ignoring empty canvas space).
2. **Column Scanning:** Iterate through the X-axis columns. For each column, find the lowest pixel where `alpha > 200` (strict threshold to ignore denim fuzz/shadows).
3. **Candidate Collection:** Store these `(x, y)` points. This represents the bottom contour of the object.

### 2. The "Smart" RANSAC Implementation
Replace the current angle calculation with this robust RANSAC approach:
1. **Filter Outliers:** Ignore the first 15% and last 15% of the X-axis width points. This automatically removes the "curved corners" of bags/bottles that throw off the calculation.
2. **Run RANSAC:**
   - Randomly select 2 points from the remaining central bottom points.
   - Calculate the line.
   - Count "inliers" (points within **5px** distance of the line - increased from 2.5px to handle fabric texture).
   - Repeat 200 times.
3. **Consensus Check:** If the best line has < 25% of points agreeing, return 0 (do not rotate). This prevents "forcing" a rotation on circular or irregular objects.

### 3. Code Structure
Export these two main functions:
- `detectSkewAngle(imageSrc: string, canvas: HTMLCanvasElement): Promise<number>`
- `rotateImage(imageSrc: string, angleDegrees: number): Promise<string>` (Use the translate-rotate-draw method to center the image).

### Requirements
- **No external heavy libraries** (like OpenCV). Use raw Canvas API `getImageData`.
- **Performance:** Resize the analysis canvas to max-width 600px before processing to save CPU.
- **Safety:** Clamp max rotation to +/- 15 degrees. If calculated > 15, return 0.
